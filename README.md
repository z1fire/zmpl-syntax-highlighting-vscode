# zmpl README

This is some basic syntax highlighting for zmpl to easily see the html and zig in a zmpl file. probably some bugs but usable.  
You can clone this repo into the extension folder for your vscode. if the syntax highlighting isnt showing up check to make sure  
that the zmpl is not reading as plain text if it is change it to ZMPL.
